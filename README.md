## Issues

The issue tracker is [here](https://todo.sr.ht/~shakna/jwsgi).

It supports non-user interactions, and plain-text email.

There is currently no `setup.py` as `jwsgi` is still undergoing breaking changes.

However, it is a 0-dependency Python library, so you can simply copy it to the appropriate place for importing into your project.
